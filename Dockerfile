# Debian rather than Alpine, and the reason is Python.
#
# PyPI's binary wheels target manylinux, which means glibc. On musl, pip falls
# back to building from source for a large part of the ecosystem — numpy, pandas,
# cryptography, anything with a C extension — which needs a toolchain in the image
# and turns `pip install` from seconds into minutes, or into a compiler error an
# agent cannot do anything about. musllinux wheels exist and cover far less.
#
# The cost is a larger base (tens of megabytes against Alpine's five). Paid
# deliberately: an image where Python is nominally present and practically unusable
# is worse than a bigger one where it works.

# The tools an agent is likely to reach for, plus the ones the service needs.
#
# ca-certificates is not optional: OIDC discovery and the token endpoint are https
# calls to Keycloak, and without the trust store the server refuses to start with
# an opaque x509 error. Agents also fetch over https constantly.
#
# tini is here for one reason: the worker would otherwise be PID 1, and a PID 1
# that does not wait() leaks a zombie for every orphan reparented to it. An agent
# running `npm run dev &` and then hitting a timeout leaves two — the process group
# is killed correctly, but nobody collects the corpses, and nothing reaps them
# lazily either. Measured on a real deployment, still there minutes later.
#
# An in-process reaper was the alternative and is worse here: wait4(-1) races the
# wait() that os/exec already does for every tracked child, and losing that race
# turns a finished command into "waitid: no child processes". With tini as PID 1
# the worker keeps its own children and only genuine orphans reparent past it, so
# there is no race to lose. It also forwards SIGTERM, which the graceful shutdown
# depends on.
#
# Deliberately absent: a compiler toolchain. build-essential is most of a
# quarter-gigabyte, and with glibc wheels the common cases do not need it. Add it
# here if your agents' tasks turn out to.
